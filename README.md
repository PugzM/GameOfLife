DESCRIPTION
-----------

Game of life is a cellular autonomation game that uses simple rules to generate life-like cells with emergent properties such as self-replication, and oscillation patterns.

I developed this game as a learning project for my development in learning java.

Game.java is the main class file.

Download and run Game of Life.jar to see the finished program.
